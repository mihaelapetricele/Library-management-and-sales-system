**Library management and sales system**

	This project is an online bookstore for a group of users who may also be individuals or legal entities. The system contains a database that will store information about books in stock, products purchased, and customer login information. Users will interact with the system through an easy-to-understand interface.
	This site will contain a menu with the following links:	
	   o Home
	   o Books
	       • Fiction
           • History
           • Romance
           • Food
           • Comics & Graphics Novels
           • Children's Books
           • Mystery & Thrillers
           • Arts & Photography
	   o Contact
	   o About	
	
	At the top of the main page of the site there is a Login icon that directs the user to the login page to log in with his credentials or to create a new account if he is new on the page.
	After creating the account, the user will be directed to the product page. He will be able to select from the menu the department where he wants to buy the books. He will be able to add the desired books to the cart or add them to the wishlist option by pressing the heart-shaped button below each card. There will also be a button at the top of the window that will redirect the user to the shopping cart.
    The administrator user, after logging in, will be able to view existing products as a list. It will have 3 buttons: add product, edit product and delete product.
